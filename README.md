# OpenArchive
A opensource archive.

I want people to add on to the archive.
I do not mind if you use this code; the code is writen in python.
I would like some credit.
If you add on to the archive there is a dictionary in the code.
Add the syntax then the function.
Also add your name to the spot that says "contributors" in the dictionary if you want to be reconized.

To operate the archive type the syntax.
I do not have the "help_syntax" command/syntax working yet. 
You will have to read part of the code to find the syntaxes!

Thank you, enjoy the Archive.
